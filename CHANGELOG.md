## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-18

### Added

#### Core Queue Features
- Persistent, disk-backed message queue with FIFO ordering guarantees
- Automatic segment rotation (configurable by size, count, or both)
- Read position persistence across queue restarts
- Crash-safe durability with append-only log design
- Thread-safe concurrent access for multiple producers and consumers
- Efficient batch operations (EnqueueBatch/DequeueBatch) with single fsync
- Sparse indexing for fast lookups with minimal overhead

#### Advanced Features
- **Streaming API** - Real-time push-based message delivery with context support
- **Message TTL (Time-To-Live)** - Automatic message expiration with lazy evaluation during dequeue
- **Message Headers** - Key-value metadata for routing, tracing, event sourcing, and workflow orchestration
- **Replay Capabilities** - Seek by message ID or timestamp for event replay
- **Compaction & Retention** - Automatic background or manual cleanup with configurable retention policies
- **Metrics Collection** - Zero-dependency in-memory metrics for monitoring and observability
- **Pluggable Logging** - Optional structured logging with custom logger interface

#### Public API
- Clean, stable public API package (`pkg/ledgerq`)
- Comprehensive configuration via Options pattern with sensible defaults
- Statistics API exposing queue state and performance metrics
- Context-aware streaming with graceful shutdown support

#### Developer Experience
- **CLI Tool** - Command-line tool for queue inspection, statistics, compaction, and peeking
- **Comprehensive Examples** - 7 runnable examples covering all major features
- **Fuzzing Tests** - Go 1.18+ fuzzing for format parsers and queue operations
- **Extensive Test Coverage** - >75% coverage across all core components
- **Race Detection** - Full test suite passes with -race flag
- **Comprehensive Documentation** - Complete README with usage examples, architecture details, and best practices

#### Testing & Quality
- 100+ test cases covering core functionality, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Integration tests for multi-segment scenarios and crash recovery
- Benchmarks for performance measurement and optimization
- Fuzzing tests for robustness (entry format, queue operations)
- Property-based testing for invariants

#### Project Infrastructure
- Go module with semantic versioning
- Makefile with development tasks (build, test, lint, bench, fuzz)
- CI/CD configuration (ready for GitHub Actions)
- Linter configuration (golangci-lint)
- Project documentation (CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY)
- Apache 2.0 license

### Changed
- N/A (initial release)

### Performance Characteristics
- Single operations: ~300-400 ns/op enqueue (without sync)
- Batch operations: ~200 ns per message (10x improvement)
- With AutoSync: ~19 ms/op (includes fsync)
- Concurrent: Excellent scalability with 8+ writers
- Dequeue: ~700 Î¼s/op (with disk read)

### Design Highlights
- Zero dependencies beyond Go standard library
- Pure Go implementation (no C dependencies or external tools)
- Segment-based storage for efficient compaction
- Backward-compatible format extensions via feature flags
- Optional features with zero overhead when unused
